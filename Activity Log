  Wed 29th:
    - search for papers for lit review started

Week 2:
  Tues 4th Feb:
    - Developed Object detector on laptop
  Thurs 6th Feb:
    - Met with supervisor, will focus on connection through sockets
  Fri 7th Feb:
    - Develop code to test with Pepper to see if object recognition works
    - Ready to test with Pepper next week

Week 3:
  Mon 10th Feb:
    - Started interim report focused on project background and began to write new aims and objectives.
  Wed 12th Feb:
    - Worked on laptop within VM tried to get NAOqi library to work, will try to get window version with Mike working
  Thurs 13th Feb:
    - Meeting with supervisor, transferring frames to a file to be viewed and processed.
    - Got conda environments setup and qi import to work.
  Fri 14th Feb:
    - Working on getting camera feed and applying object detector, would freeze and need to create a third script to resolve this.

Week 4:
  Mon 17th Feb:
    - Interim report continued, started on progress report.
  Tue 18th Feb:
    - Interim report continued, made some diagrams, draft literature review added.
    - New code for frames created, ready to be tested.
  Wed 19th Feb:
    - Interim report continued added diagrams, comparison and changes with plan, ready to give to supervisor for feedback.
  Thurs 20th Feb:
    - Pepper feed displayed, significant lag and latency

Week 5:
  Mon 24th Feb:
    - Imterim report almost finished, just video left
  Wed 26th Feb:
    - Researched methods to visualise objects in real space
  Thurs 27th Feb:
    - Anaconda environment gone, fixes made
  Friday 28th Feb:
    - Pepper camer latency resolve, can show real time object detection.

Week 6:
  Mon 3rd March:
    - Started to structure/map dissertation
    - Created code for to test moving towards object, ready for testing.
  Wed 4th March:
    - Pepper will follow object using a set distance
    - Need to check how to get pepper to move the correct distance
    - Need to look at angle for arm movement as tried to go backwards
  Fri 7th March:
    - Subscribes to depth and video camera
    - Resoultion stuck at 160x90 when need 320x240
    - So can't get Z co-ordinate 

Week 7:
  - Calibrated camera
  - Arm will lift towards object
  - Pepper will say the object it has detected

Week 8:
  Mon 17th March:
    - Wrote modular code for better format and additional implemtation
  Tue 18th March:
    - Tested new code
    - Will move when object is detected, need to check how it gets co-ordinates as values seem unreasonable
  Wed 19th March:
    - Depth Smoothing explored different methods to filter/remove noise to be more accurate
    - Implemented in code
  Thurs 20th March:
    - Vids of Pepper moving to object
    - Pepper will raise arm when reached object

Week 9:
  - Report writing focus
  - YOLO recognition
  - Robot map
  - Co-ordinates
  - Code structuring
